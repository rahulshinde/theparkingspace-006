						<span class='artist_name'>The Family Folk Machine</span> is Iowa City’s intergenerational, non-auditioned choir. Founded in 2013, the FFM seeks to build community by singing with our neighbors, to explore American history and culture through song, to nurture individual musical growth in our members, and to pursue excellence as an ensemble. Accompanied by a versatile band, the FFM performs music from many genres and regularly incorporates the work of local songwriters, including original songs by FFM kids and adults. As public life opens back up, we are excited to be out in the community again through large concerts and small neighborhood appearances. The Family Folk Machine is directed by Jean Littlejohn with associate directors Jon Ranard and Alma Drake.
